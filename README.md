# Telecommunication-Customer-Churn

This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the telecommunication sector using data science techniques. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to discontinue services based on their usage patterns and demographic data.

The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and the development of machine learning models to predict churn. Visualization and insights were created using Python and Streamlit to understand key factors influencing customer retention.
